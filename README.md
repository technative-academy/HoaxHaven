## Our Journey

<details>
<summary>Day 1 Summary - Monday</summary>

### Key Discussions and Decisions:

#### 1. Leadership and Decision Making:

- No designated leader; decisions made by mutual agreement.

#### 2. Pull Requests (PRs) and Documentation:

- Document new API routes and link them in the PR.
- Each PR creates or modifies the corresponding file in the docs folder.
- Initial leniency on PRs; priorities will be determined as we progress.

#### 3. Work Distribution:

- Focus on working on separate parts of the backend to avoid conflicts.
- Use pair programming if blocked.

#### 4. Frontend Responsiveness:

- Use Peteâ€™s existing frontend and CSS initially.
- Focus on mobile-first design if time permits.

#### 5. Authentication:

- Start with regular authentication; OAuth is a backlog item.
- Consider using BCrypt/passportjs for authentication later.

#### 6. TypeScript and Strict Mode:

- Not using TypeScript for now.

#### 7. Database and Migrations:

- Use regular Pool SQL queries instead of a migration library like Knex.

#### 8 Hosting Platform:

- Decided to use Railway instead of Render.

#### 9. Documentation:

- Maintain documentation manually with Markdown in the docs folder.

#### 10. Testing:

Prioritize authentication tests if time permits.
Other tests are a backlog item.

#### 11. Features and Enhancements:

- Implement tags on posts.
- Pagination is low priority and will be considered later.

#### 12. Frontend Development:

- Utilize Peteâ€™s frontend and modify if we have time.

#### 13. Database and API:

- Create news articles and reports on events in fictional worlds or parallel universes.
- Build APIs for news updates to create a continuous alternate reality game.

#### 14. Backlog Items:

- Tests for authentication.
- OAuth implementation.
- Mockable database.

## Day 1 Accomplishments

- Database Schema: Initial schema design discussed and drafted.
- GitHub Repository: Set up the repository for the project.
- Trello Board: Created a Trello board to track tasks and progress.
- DB Hosting Decision: Evaluated options for database hosting (Nicoâ€™s option, Peteâ€™s DB, - Supabase).
- Express Endpoints: Discussed potential endpoints based on frontend requirements.
- File Structure: Reviewed and planned the projectâ€™s file structure.
- Hosting Strategy: Decided to start on localhost and consider hosting later for security reasons.
- Cloudflare Tunnels: Considered for future use.
- Prettier Configuration: Set up Prettier for code formatting.

## Next Steps

- Finalize database schema and set up the initial database.
- Start implementing API endpoints.
- Continue documenting progress and decisions.
- Set up basic authentication.
- Plan and begin integrating the frontend with the backend.
